This robot system realizes the sharing of experience using an immersive VR display and the 5th generation mobile communication system (5G). The robot is equipped with a 360-degrees video camera and real-time 4K video is transmitted to a remote operator using a large communication capacity of 5G network.

By using this system, for example, older people with a disability for their leg can experience like taking a stroll from a remote place with his grandchild through a robot.
