The purpose of this project is the development of a robot system for substituting Tour-Guide task, especially in a theme park. 

The feature of this system is QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System) which is used for localization. QZSS is one of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and can achieve centimeter-level measurement via Quasi-Zenith Orbit Satellite.
